# Sasha Mishkin's site
I'm a 4th-year undergrad student at Carnegie Mellon who loves computer graphics :)

This site is going to contain details about my past and current technical projects, when I get around to setting this up fully.

## About me

## Other Coding Projects

### Walk on Spheres for Poisson Surface Reconstruction
This was my final project for CMU's Physics-Based Rendering course. I will share code and more details on it later

### Game Programming
todo: add description
#### Small Games

#### Final Game
I should be working on said final game instead of writing this right now.

## Non-technical stuff
I have interests besides math & graphics programming, probably

### 3D Art
I enjoy making 3D models in Blender in my free time so I will post some of my favorite projects!

### Linguistics
I'm minoring in linguistics, which is mostly very unrelated to computer graphics but that is largely why I took on this minor - it's been nice to explore a different field sometimes, for a change of pace. I have always found languages, speech noises, and logical patterns to be very fun to study and talk about, and linguistics involves all of those!

I made a conlang and will link it here later.
