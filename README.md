Welcome to my website! I'm **Sasha Mishkin**, a 4th-year undergrad math major at Carnegie Mellon who loves computer graphics :)

This site is going to contain details about my past and current research & creations, when I get around to setting this up fully.

## About me
todo

## Research Projects
I'm involved in an ongoing research project at CMU under the supervision of Prof. Ioannis Gkioulekas. The topic of the project is surface reconstruction from point clouds. We plan to submit a paper on the project to SIGGRAPH this January if all goes well, and I will share updates on the submission/publication status.

## Other Coding Projects
I'm passionate about all sorts of coding but especially enjoy creative coding (for example, games and shaders) and implementing graphics research.

### Walk on Spheres for Poisson Surface Reconstruction
This was my final project for CMU's Physics-Based Rendering course. Normally, students implement an advanced rendering technique for this project, but instead I implemented a Monte Carlo solver for Poisson Surface Reconstruction that ended up introducing me to key ideas in my (above) research project. I will try to share the project's code later, if I can manage to separate its code from the educational renderer (DIRT) in which I built the solver.

I made a [writeup](https://github.com/sasha-of-the-pixels/aboutme/blob/main/15_468_Report_sasha_noteaser.pdf) on the project. Credits not mentioned in the writeup include Ioannis Gkioulekas for supervising the project as the course instructor and [Alan Lee](https://github.com/Alan7996) (teaching assistant at the time) for debugging help.

I have some future plans for this project - I would like to use raymarching and possibly also Harnack tracing (as in [this paper](https://markjgillespie.com/Research/harnack-tracing/index.html)) to render reconstructed surfaces.

### Game Programming
todo: add description
#### Small Games

#### Final Game
I should be working on said final game instead of writing this right now.

### Shaders
Those are fun! (todo)

## Non-technical stuff
I have interests besides math & graphics programming, probably

### 3D Art
I enjoy making 3D models in Blender in my free time so I will post some of my favorite projects!

### Linguistics
I'm minoring in linguistics, which is mostly very unrelated to computer graphics but that is largely why I took on this minor - it's been nice to explore a different field sometimes, for a change of pace. I have always found languages, speech noises, and logical patterns to be very fun to study and talk about, and linguistics involves all of those!

I made a conlang and will link it here later.
